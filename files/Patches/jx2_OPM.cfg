// Compatibility with Outer Planets.

// OPM (and perhaps other solar-system-enlarging mods) tinker with the tracking
// station settings to give the player the ability to communicate farther than
// the stock game allows.  Since we're solving that problem by adding the big
// 1000G antenna, we don't want any buffs to the tracking station. Therefore,
// apply a patch after everything else, which forces the tracking station
// values to what the stock game uses.
