	description = This enormous, high-powered relay antenna was commissioned by Blinkenlights LLC after someone asked "What happens if we go further out than the Kerbol system?"  It most definitely is not in response to any vessels having accidentally already achieved an escape trajectory from the system.  Nope, nothing to do with that issue at all.
